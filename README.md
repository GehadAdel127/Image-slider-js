📸 Image Slider
A simple and responsive Image Slider built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This slider allows users to seamlessly navigate through a collection of images using navigation arrows or automatic transitions.

✨ Features

Smooth sliding animations

Manual navigation (next/prev buttons)

Optional autoplay with configurable delay

Lightweight – no external libraries or frameworks

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML – Structure of the slider and image elements

CSS – Styling, layout, and animations

JavaScript – Slide control logic, transitions, and interactivity

🚀 How It Works
The HTML provides a container with images laid out in a row.

CSS is used to style the slider and enable overflow scrolling with smooth transitions.

JavaScript handles the navigation logic, updating the current image based on user input or a timer.
